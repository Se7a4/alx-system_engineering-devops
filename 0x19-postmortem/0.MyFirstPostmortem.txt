Incident Summary:
During the 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects task, I encountered a recurring issue with pycodestyle checks failing across all tasks. This problem was identified when I received multiple errors during the submission process.

Root Cause:
The issue was caused by my forgetting to adhere to the pycodestyle guidelines while writing my Python code. This oversight led to syntax and formatting errors that were caught by the automatic checks.

Resolution and Recovery:
After realizing the issue, I spent about 10-15 minutes reviewing the pycodestyle guidelines and correcting the code to conform to the required standards. Once the code was properly formatted, all checks passed successfully.

Lessons Learned:
I learned the importance of adhering to coding standards, particularly pycodestyle, from the start of the task. This helps avoid unnecessary delays and ensures that the code is clean and maintainable.

Follow-Up Actions:
To prevent similar issues in the future, I will incorporate a pycodestyle check into my workflow before submission. Additionally, I plan to familiarize myself further with the style guidelines to minimize errors.
